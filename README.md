For a novel drug to gain approval and become available to patients, it has to undergo three phases of clinical trials. Each phase requires dozens to thousands of participants to determine the appropriate dosage, effectiveness, and safety of the drug. However, there is a significant need to improve communication between potential participants and researchers. The protocols and study plans accessible to potential participants are often filled with technical jargon, making it difficult for patients to understand what to expect from the trial. This confusion can lead to participants unknowingly accepting risks or being discouraged from participating due to misunderstandings. Currently, communication between researchers and patients is largely one-sided, depending on patients to seek out information, which often results in insufficient recruitmentâ€”approximately 80% of clinical trials close due to insufficient enrollment.

To address this issue, we propose ClinicalConsent. By utilizing the GPT API, ClinicalConsent simplifies complex study plans and protocols into clear, understandable information for participants. Additionally, our platform includes a recommendation system that matches potential participants with suitable clinical trials based on their profiles and the available studies. ClinicalConsent will facilitate effective communication between potential participants and researchers, promoting a safer and more engaged interaction throughout the clinical trial process.
